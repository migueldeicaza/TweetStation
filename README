TweetStation

	TweetStation was originally a sample program that I created
	for my own use.  I was a fan of the older UI in Echofon and
	liked many of the elements of Tweetie2, but like every
	programmer, I wanted to make some changes.

	It was also a test bed for testing APIs and answering
	MonoTouch users's questions.  It is the original application
	that lead to the creation of MonoTouch.Dialog, as I figured
	that there should be a better way of constructing dialog boxes
	than creating models and delegates left and right.

	TweetStation is an open source, MIT X11 licensed twitter
	client written for MonoTouch.   See the file LICENSE for
	details.

Design Goals
============

   The Murray Hill Style

	For years researchers from Bell Labs at Murray Hill published
	various computer books on C, Unix, compilers and design that
	were incredibly succinct.   They were amazing pieces of code
	that were short and concise.  I call this style of code the
	Murray Hill style.

	The TweetStation code was not designed to be incredibly
	extensible or reusable as-is.   I wrote this code to be succinct
	and short, if it is reusable for other projects it is an 
	unintended side effect.

	If you want to reuse code from TweetStation, you will likely
	want to alter it to suit your needs.

   Exceptions

	The code uses try/catch extensively in the code in areas that
	have to process data from twitter, I assume that the data
	might be broken or that my original assumptions or their
	documentation might be wrong.  You will notice in the code
	that all exceptions are printed out, I want to keep that this
	way for that reason.

   MonoTouch.Dialog

	Most of the UI was created with MonoTouch.Dialog and various
	custom views and Elements designed for twitter.  There is not
	a single UITableView coded in the traditional style.

   Memory Usage

	In some parts of the code I tried to minimize memory usage by
	not creating thousands of objects that would be thrown out
	(Tweet parsing for example), so I just recycle some instances
	sometimes.

	The ImageStore is also specialized for Twitter use, for instance
	the keys kept in the cache and on the file system are keyed by
	a long value and not by the URL, so we are not forced to keep
	the strings for the Urls in memory.

	A general purpose image downloader/cache would use URLs or
	something else.

   Singletons

	There are a handful of singleton classes as well, I tend to
	reset those instead of creating new instances as they would
	avoid creating expensive objects or objects that are known to
	leak in CocoaTouch anyways.

   Pending Task Queue

	I never know if a tweet has been starred or not when there is
	no network connectivity.   With TweetStation all the pending
	requests are kept in a queue and flushed at periodic intervals.

	This is used both to post tweets and favorite posts, allowing
	the settings to take place right away, even if there is no
	network connectivity

OAuth and xAuth
===============

	TweetStation supports both OAuth and xAuth authentication from
	twitter.   Currently the source code is hardcoded to the values
	that I obtained by registering my app at:

		http://dev.twitter.com/apps

	It uses OAuth by default and it does this by opening an embedded
	UIWebView to let the user enter their login and password and 
	granting the user authorization over at Twitter's site.

	To improve the experience, Twitter offers access to xAuth, but
	this requires application developers to request from Twitter
	special access, you can enable this for your code if you
	negotiate this.
