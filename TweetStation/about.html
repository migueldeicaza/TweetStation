	<p><a href="http://tirania.org/tweetstation">TweetStation</a> is a
	twitter client designed to elevate the level of discourse on Twitter,
	reduce your stress levels and help you become a better Twetizen.
	
	<p>At a conceptual level, this is achieved by applying the cardinal rule
	of not taking anything too seriously, specially any interactions you
	might have online.
	
	<p>At a practical level this is achieved with two features.  The first
	feature plays back chicken noises whenever you request more Tweets.
	The chicken noises have been engineered to remind you that no matter
	how important an argument appears to be in Twitter, you should not
	take it too seriously.
	
	<p>When you compose a message with TweetStation <a
	href="http://incompetech.com">Kevin MacLeod's</a> Scheming Weasel
	starts playing back in the background.  This music was specially
	selected to elicit in you the desire to write a witty and clever
	response.  The kind of tweet that your local newspaper would publish
	in the front page, or in their "Social Media Expert" column.
	
	<p>But there is an elephant in the room, and I want to speak directly
	about it.  Many Twitteristas are concerned about the Tweetpocalypse
	and Twitter's transition to use some bizarro world non-feature called
	OAuth.   
	
	<p>Tweetstation is feature packed and does not suffer from either
	problem.  You can trust that Tweetstation was developed using the best
	engineering techniques available today, and that you will never be the
	victim of the Tweetpocalypse and be left incommunicado due to some
	silly programming mistake.  Not in this 32-bit century, not in the
	next, and not under my watch.  If my years of experience taught me one
	thing is and one thing only, it is when to use a 32-bit integer data
	type and when to use a 64-bit one.  Do not fear dear user, I also
	master many other data types, but I digress.
	
	<p>But you might be wondering, why another Twitter client, and why now?
	As a twitterista you know that there is a special bond, an intimate
	bond if you will, between the twitterista and his twitter client.
	This bond can exist as long as both the twitterista and the twitter
	client grow hand in hand, if they co-develop.  And I found myself at
	odds with the design decisions and paths that other twitter clients
	were taking.  In a metaphorical way, I felt uncomfortable, like a
	Woody Allen character under pressure.  But a character that lacked
	Woody Allen's command of the language.
	
	<p>And this is how TweetStation was born, it was a labor of love, but
	mostly of social awkwardness when my friends mocked my Twitter client
	for lacking a chicken noise, or when they suggested things at dinner
	like "would it not be cool if...".  I decided to change all that, and
	make sure that other twitteristas in the future did not feel the
	social scorn that I had gone through, and this is why TweetStation's
	source code is open source.  
		
	<h4>Open Source</h4>
	
	<p>I am inviting the world to extend this twitter client by releasing
	the source code to the public.   If you want some features, and the features
	fit with the vision of TweetStation, I will be happy to integrate those code
	contributions.   If you would rather take this twitter client into a completely
	different direction, you can do that too.
	
	<p>TweetStation is open source, you can download the source code for TweetStation
	from <a href="http://github.com/migueldeicaza/tweetstation">github.com/migueldeicaza</a>
	and either extend it for your own purposes, add the features that you thought
	were missing, remove the features that you did not like, or borrow code for your
	own use in your own applications.   TweetStation is licensed under the terms 
	of the MIT X11 license which means that you can use the code it in commercial apps,
	in any setting that might be useful to you.   You only are required to keep the
	credits in the source code.   Giving credit is a bonus, but not necessary.</p>
	
	<h4>Technology</h4>
	
	<p>TweetStation is written in C# using <a href="http://monotouch.net">MonoTouch</a> 
	and most of the user interface elements were created with my <a href="http://github.com/migueldeicaza/MonoTouch.Dialog">
	MonoTouch.Dialog</a> framework for rapidly creating table-based applications.
	
	<h4>Credits</h4>
	
	<p>The audio is from <a href="http://twitter.com/kmacleod">Kevin MacLeod</a> and the
	chicken noises were sampled at our Cambridge development office.
	</p>
	
	<p>The heads-up-display widget was written by Devin Ross for the Tapku library,
	I am using Eduardo Scoz' port to MonoTouch (escoz) and it is MIT X11 licensed as
	well.</p>
	
	<p>No Credits section is complete without acknowledging the brilliant work of
	Fernando Magariños, Noam Chomsky, the late Howard Zinn and Benjamin Zander.</p>
